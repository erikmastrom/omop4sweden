With 31 international and national speakers and panelists and over 150 participants, we explored the opportunities that the OMOP Common Data Model and the open-science assets of the global OHDSI network offer to transform Real-World Data (RWD) into Real-World Evidence (RWE), all for a higher purpose.

                👉 The key takeaway!
                Sweden needs to increase its awareness and adoption of the OMOP Common Data Model to harmonize our valuable health data assets enabling secure and effective reuse of health data.</p> <a target="_blank" class="flex bg-gray-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-2xl hover:bg-omop_blue transition-transform duration-200 hover:scale-105 items-center justify-center lg:text-base text-sm lg:max-w-4/10 max-w-7/10 italic place-self-center text-center">Read more & View the Presentations</a></div> <h2 class="text-6xl font-serif mb-6 text-center">Events</h2> <p class="text-center text-gray-900 m-2 lg:text-base mb-10">Below are some events where you can learn more about OMOP and related relevant topics.
