They were the first early adopters. It was AstraZeneca and WHO's Uppsala Monitoring Center. They took initiative to form part of the consortium for the EHDEN initiative funded through the Innovative Medicines Initiative, supported by European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA.<br/> <br/> A few organisations have followed them and become data partners with either EHDEN Foundation and/or EMA's DARWIN-EU. For example, the department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics (MEB) at Karolinska Institutet, the department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences (BKV) at Linköping University, who have mapped the Swedish Inflammatory Bowel Disease Registry to OMOP, and finally the research project SCIFI-PEARL (Swedish Covid-19 Investigation for Future Insights – a Population Epidemiology Approach using Register Linkage) at Gothenburg University. This last data set has recently, April 2025, also become the first Swedish data partner within EMA's DARWIN-EU network.<br/> <br/> More organisations are starting to explore the potential of OMOP and the methods and tools from the open-science network OHDSI. Below you can read more about the early adopters of OMOP, OHDSI and federated analysis in Sweden. If you know of any organisation not listed below, please let us know.</p> <!></section>`);function f(t){var e=l(),o=i(r(e),4);d(o),s(e),n(t,e)}export{f as component};
