Originally developed through a public-private partnership between the FDA and pharmaceutical industry, OMOP has evolved into the most adopted global standard for observational health data research and for other use-cases within the area of secondary use of health data.

At its core, OMOP solves a fundamental challenge in healthcare research and analysis: enabling secure and regulatory compliant data analysis on fragmented data sources. Healthcare data exists in countless formats across hospitals, clinics, insurance databases, and research institutions. OMOP creates a common language that allows researchers to analyse data from multiple sources and generate Real-World Evidence with effect and speed.

The OMOP CDM standardizes not just data structure, but also vocabulary and concepts. This means that a diagnosis of diabetes in Stockholm can be seamlessly compared with the same condition recorded in New York or Tokyo, enabling truly global health research at unprecedented scale.

Watch this short video about OMOP and federated data networks:

`},{title:"The Origin of OMOP",content:`The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) was launched in 2008 as a public–private partnership led by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pharma Researchers and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), and Foundations for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) to explore how large-scale observational health data could be standardized and used to detect drug safety signals. 

From their work, the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and methods library were developed to harmonize diverse health data sources and enable reproducible analytics. After the partnership ended in 2014, the global OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) community was formed to continue expanding OMOP CDM, which today underpins a worldwide federated research network across academia, industry, and healthcare.`},{title:"What is OHDSI?",content:`The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network is an international open-science community that maintains and develops OMOP, its associated methods and open-source tooling. The OHDSI community members also collaborate on a large number of studies and research projects using OMOP-standardized data sets from different parts of the world. 

Founded in 2014, OHDSI brings together researchers, clinicians, data scientists, and healthcare organizations from over 75 countries who share a common goal: generating reliable evidence from health data to improve patient outcomes.

OHDSI operates as an open science collaborative, meaning all tools, methods, and research are freely available. The community develops and maintains:
- The OMOP Common Data Model and its standardized vocabularies
- Open-source analytical tools and software
- Best practices for observational health research
- Educational resources and training materials
- Quality assurance frameworks and data validation tools

What makes OHDSI unique is its commitment to transparency, reproducibility, and collaborative science. Research conducted using OMOP can be replicated across different datasets and countries, creating a robust evidence base for healthcare decision-making.`},{title:"OMOP user groups",content:`Healthcare Researchers and Epidemiologists: OMOP enables large-scale, multi-site studies that would be impossible with traditional data silos. Researchers can conduct population health studies, comparative effectiveness research, and safety surveillance across diverse patient populations.

Healthcare Providers and Health Systems: Hospitals and healthcare networks can leverage OMOP to benchmark their outcomes against national and international standards, perform treatment pathway analysis, healthcare benchmark studies, quality improvement initiatives and vaccine effectiveness and safety assessments, as well as participate in collaborative research networks and clinical studies.

Pharmaceutical and Biotech Companies: Life sciences companies use OMOP for real-world evidence generation, post-market safety surveillance, cohort discovery, characterization studies, clinical trial design, predictive modelling, and regulatory submissions to agencies like EMA and FDA.

Health Authorities and Policymakers: Government agencies and health authorities utilize OMOP for population health monitoring, drug safety signal detection, post-authorisation safety studies, infectious disease surveillance, health technology assessment, and evidence-based policy development.

Health Technology Companies: Digital health companies, EHR vendors, and health analytics firms can build OMOP-compatible solutions that integrate seamlessly with the global research ecosystem.`},{title:"Want to learn more about OMOP and OHDSI?",content:`Here are five pragmatic steps you can take to learn more about OMOP and the OHDSI community:

1) Start with OHDSI’s official resources – Explore the OHDSI Book of OHDSI and the OHDSI website to get an overview of OMOP CDM, ETL processes, and analytic methods.

2) Join the OHDSI community calls and forums – Weekly open community calls and the OHDSI forums are great places to learn, ask questions, and see real-world applications.

3) Take hands-on training – Explore the EHDEN Academy which offers free structured courses on OMOP CDM, data mapping, cohort building, and federated analysis.

4) Experiment with OMOP tools – Install and test open-source OHDSI tools like ATLAS (cohort design, characterization) and ACHILLES (data quality checks) using sample OMOP datasets.

5) Engage in a real project or use case – The fastest way to learn is to participate in an actual OMOP ETL, mapping, or analysis project, either within your institution, via OHDSI study-a-thons, or through collaborations like EHDEN and OMOP 4 Sweden.

Engage with us - OMOP 4 Sweden - and be part of the movement driving the adoption of OMOP in Sweden.`},{title:"Start your learning roadmap on OMOP/OHDSI",content:`Beginner (0–3 months) — Foundations

Effective use of Swedish health data, often in collaboration with international research networks, university hospitals, industry players, registry organizations and larger cross-border initiatives, is of central importance in the national life science strategy and has been so since the strategy was introduced in 2019. One of the priority areas - #2 Utilizing health and care data for research and innovation -  highlights several needs and challenges that can be addressed through the use of OMOP, its analytical methods and open-source tools, and the global OHDSI community that develops OMOP and connects the world in federated data networks around health data.

The strategy also mentions the following need – “Making data accessible also means enabling data analysis and eliminating the need to transfer data from different sources (e.g. federated data)”, - which is at the core of OMOP’s and OHDSI’s capabilities. 

Access and effective use of health data, OMOP's core, can also play an important role in other priority areas within the national life science strategy, for example:
- The Nordic region as a globally leading life science player (strategy priority area #1.4)
- Development and equitable implementation of precision health and advanced therapies (#3.1)
- Research in regulatory science for the benefit of the development of new medicines and new medical devices (#3.4)
- More high-quality clinical trials (#4.1)
- Implementation of research findings and innovation in clinical practice (#4.3)
- Countering antimicrobial resistance through new working methods and new products (#4.4)
- High-quality, excellent & internationally leading research in life science (#6.1)
- Excellent research infrastructure in the life science area (#6.2)
- Infrastructures for data-driven research and innovation (#6.4)
- Attracting and retaining international recruitment in Sweden (#7.3)
- Swedish participation in EU life science programmes and initiatives (#8.5)

Sweden needs to increase and accelerate the rollout of OMOP and its analytical tools from the OHDSI network, to address many needs and challenges detailed in the nation's life science strategy.`}],l=Z(null);function S(o){ee(l,p(l)===o?null:o)}let _=Z(!1);function j(o){const c=new IntersectionObserver(([u])=>{u.isIntersecting&&(ee(_,!0),c.unobserve(o))},{threshold:.01});c.observe(o)}ce();var f=Fe(),R=a(f);{var F=o=>{var c=Re(),u=t(a(c),2);Ie(u,5,()=>w,Ee,(v,b,H)=>{var I=je(),d=a(I),h=a(d),E=a(h,!0);e(h);var x=t(h,2),N=a(x);{var A=i=>{var r=Te();y(()=>n(r,"src",`${s??""}/minus.svg`)),m(i,r)},W=i=>{var r=ze();y(()=>n(r,"src",`${s??""}/plus.svg`)),m(i,r)};$(N,i=>{p(l)===H?i(A):i(W,!1)})}e(x),e(d);var C=t(d,2);{var B=i=>{var r=$e(),M=a(r),G=t(M);{var T=z=>{var L=Le();m(z,L)};$(G,z=>{p(b).title==="What is OMOP?"&&z(T)})}e(r),y(()=>oe(M,`${p(b).content??""} `)),m(i,r)};$(C,i=>{p(l)===H&&i(B)})}e(I),y(()=>oe(E,p(b).title)),ke("click",d,()=>S(H)),m(v,I)}),e(u);var P=t(u,2),D=a(P);e(P);var U=t(P,2);Pe(U,O,"default",{}),e(c),y(()=>n(D,"href",`${s??""}/omop-internationally`)),le(1,c,()=>De,()=>({y:80,duration:700,easing:v=>v*v})),m(o,c)};$(R,o=>{p(_)&&o(F)})}e(f),Ce(f,o=>j?.(o)),m(k,f),re()}var Ne=g('<meta name="Making OMOP a formal part of the Swedish health data ecosystem" content="OMOP 4 Sweden! brings together a number of organizations in Swedish life science and healthcare who want to help Sweden build a competitive ability to effectively use our health data assets to generate valuable evidence for better healthcare.
