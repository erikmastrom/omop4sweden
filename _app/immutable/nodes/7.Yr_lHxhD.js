The OMOP Common Data Model is at the heart of EHDEN.

The EHDEN project established a broad ecosystem of more than 160 data partners and 60 certified SMEs across 29 countries, enabling large-scale, privacy-preserving research through a common framework. EHDEN has accelerated real-world evidence generation for regulators, academia, and industry, establishing Europe as a global leader in federated health data science and infrastructure.`},{logo:"/swedishOmopUsers/darwin-eu-logo.png",name:"Darwin EU",link:"https://www.darwin-eu.org/",info:`The Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network (DARWIN EU®) is the coordination centre established by The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Medicines Regulatory Network to provide timely and reliable evidence on the use, safety and effectiveness of medicines for human use, including vaccines, from real world healthcare databases across the European Union (EU).

DARWIN EU® has created a permanent federated network of real-world health data standardized to the OMOP Common Data Model. It has onboarded dozens of European data partners and already delivered studies supporting regulatory decisions on drug safety, effectiveness, and disease epidemiology. DARWIN EU® has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid, large-scale, cross-country analyses, strengthening the evidence base for EU health regulators and public health policy.

In DARWIN EU’s most recent report from early 2025 you can find these results:
- DARWIN EU® expanded to 30 data partners, with access to data from around 180 million patients from 16 European countries
- 59 studies were conducted representing a 47.5% increase year-over-year
- The proportion of feasible studies addressing initial requests increased from 60% to 78% year-over-year
- The median study duration from DARWIN EU® studies is now 4 months from protocol approval to study results`}];var r=H();N(r,5,()=>e,k,(i,n)=>{_(i,{get logo(){return s(n).logo},get name(){return s(n).name},get link(){return s(n).link},get info(){return s(n).info}})}),a(r),v(o,r)}var R=m('<section><h2 class="text-6xl font-serif mb-6 text-center">The use of OMOP Internationally</h2> <p class="lg:text-center text-gray-900 m-2 lg:text-base  mb-10">The use of OMOP is growing rapidly around the world. By the end of 2024, 544 standardized data sources in 54 countries had been standardized and harmonized with OMOP, covering 974 million patient records, or approximately 12% of the world’s population.<br/><br/> Throughout the years there have been many initiatives that all have contributed to the broad adoption of OMOP around the world. The adoption around Europe has grown significantly in recent years. Important contributions have been made by the initiative EHDEN (European Health Data & Evidence Network) and the coordination capability called DARWIN EU® (Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network) established by The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Medicines Regulatory Network.<br/><br/> EHDEN and DARWIN EU are recognized and world leading examples on building safe, effective and sustainable capabilities for secondary use of observational health data. More examples of OMOP adoption around the world will soon be added to this website.</p> <!></section>');function q(o){var e=R(),r=f(t(e),4);A(r),a(e),v(o,e)}export{q as component};
