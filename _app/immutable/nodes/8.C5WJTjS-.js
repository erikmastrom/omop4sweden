The sessions introduced OMOP as an open, community-driven standard supported by free, open-source tools that reduce vendor lock-in and enable reproducible analytics across organizations and countries.<br/> <br/> Our speakers and panelists discussed how federated analytics allows data to remain securely on site while sharing only queries, making international collaboration possible without compromising privacy. We have shown, with concrete examples from healthcare delivery, research, and innovation how OMOP is already being used in practice.<br/> <br/> The symposium also examined how OMOP complements existing standards such as openEHR, FHIR, and SNOMED CT by providing a robust analytical layer, and how it aligns with Sweden’s strategic priorities; including the EHDS, national life science strategy, and ongoing investments in registries and digital health.<br/> <br/> Overall, we have now started building momentum for national adoption by showing the opportunities OMOP creates for researchers, healthcare providers, government, and industry to collaborate more effectively.</p> <p class="text-center font-serif text-gray-900 m-2 text-2xl mb-5">Read more about our speakers and see their presentations below.</p></section> <section class="pt-5"><!></section>',1);function $(l){var e=F(),i=r(A(e),2),o=n(i);K(o),a(i),d(l,e)}export{$ as component};
