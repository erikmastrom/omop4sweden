The presentation will draw from the OMOP experience from Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) and outline key steps, required competencies, and infrastructure needed for implementation, as well as information on how to join and leverage the international OHDSI network in the process. The presentation will show how HUS has successfully navigated the process from data sources, through ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to OMOP data, quality control, to the first federated real-world study, and further into swarm-learning for predictive modelling in precision medicine. Use cases covered will include participation in DARWIN, an international OMOP study on immune checkpoint inhibitor uptake in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (iCAN mNSCLC study-a-thon), and a swarm learning study across the Finnish university hospitals to cooperatively build a predictive model in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).",link:"https://www.scilifelab.se/event/omop-as-a-standard-for-analytics-generating-real-world-evidence-and-federated-machine-learning/",logo:"/partner_logos/SciLifeLab_Logotype_Green_POS.png",organizer:"SciLifeLab"}];var s=H(),h=i(n(s),4);M(h,5,()=>w,S,(x,e)=>{var l=I(),d=n(l),o=i(d,2),g=n(o),b=n(g,!0);a(g),a(o);var c=i(o,2),O=n(c,!0);a(c);var p=i(c,2),y=n(p,!0);a(p);var _=i(p,2);a(l),k(()=>{r(d,"src",`${P??""}${t(e).logo??""}`),r(d,"alt",`${t(e).organizer??""} logo`),r(o,"href",t(e).link),m(b,t(e).name),m(O,t(e).date),m(y,t(e).description),r(_,"href",t(e).link)}),f(x,l)}),a(h),a(s),f(v,s)}export{R as component};
