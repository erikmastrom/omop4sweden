With 31 international and national speakers and panelists and over 150 participants, we explored the opportunities that the OMOP Common Data Model and the open-science assets of the global OHDSI network offer to transform Real-World Data (RWD) into Real-World Evidence (RWE), all for a higher purpose.

                👉 The key takeaway!
                Sweden needs to increase its awareness and adoption of the OMOP Common Data Model to harmonize our valuable health data assets enabling secure and effective reuse of health data.</p> <a target="_blank" class="flex bg-gray-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-2xl hover:bg-omop_blue transition-transform duration-200 hover:scale-105 items-center justify-center lg:text-base text-sm lg:max-w-4/10 max-w-7/10 italic place-self-center text-center">Read more & View the Presentations</a></div> <h2 class="text-6xl font-serif mb-6 text-center">Events</h2> <p class="text-center text-gray-900 m-2 lg:text-base mb-10">Below are some events where you can learn more about OMOP and related relevant topics.

Converting real-world health data into the OMOP Common Data Model ensures standardized, high-quality, and reusable phenotypes.

                Javier's presentation will describe how the FinnGen project uses the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model to harmonize national health registry and hospital data for large-scale genetic research. By transforming heterogeneous real-world data into OMOP-CDM using shared, reusable mappings maintained by the FinOMOP consortium, researchers enable standardized phenotyping, improved data quality, and robust multi-center analyses.

                Longitudinal, multi-source integration captures diagnostic evolution, strengthens case ascertainment, and substantially increases GWAS discovery power, demonstrating how OMOP-based harmonization enhances precision medicine research at population scale.</p> <span class="text-md lg:text-base pb-2 whitespace-pre-line"><strong>Presenter:</strong> Javier Gracia-Tabuenca, Bioinformatician at Finnish Genomic Research Organisation (FinnGen)</span> <div class="flex flex-row w-full items-center justify-center gap-10 my-5"><img alt="Swelife logo" class=" h-10 max-xl:h-8 w-auto max-lg:hidden"/> <img alt="Vinnova logo" class=" h-10 max-xl:h-8 w-auto max-lg:hidden"/> <img alt="SFMI logo" class=" h-10 max-xl:h-8 w-auto max-lg:hidden"/></div> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6XxiZ5L1ZH-Ng6PtVORzBD3WVmjy1WTfGsKpCznk_USTtoA/viewform" target="_blank" class="flex bg-gray-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-2xl hover:bg-omop_blue transition-transform duration-200 hover:scale-105 items-center justify-center lg:text-base text-sm lg:max-w-3/10 max-w-7/10 italic place-self-center text-center">Read more & Sign up</a></div> <!></div></section>`);function J(P){const k=[{name:"From research to regulators: effectively using SDTM & OMOP",date:"December 8, 16:00",description:`Join us for the final session in our OMOP webinar series.
