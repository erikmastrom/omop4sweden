They mapped their Swedish register data to the OMOP Common Data Model through the EHDEN program and became a data partner to the EHDEN Foundation. Their main research focus is on pharmacoepidemiological and drug use.

KI MEB has also used OMOP CDM on a data set connected to the Stockholm CREAtinine Measurements project that was initiated in 2010 in collaboration with the healthcare provider of Stockholm County healthcare to quantify potential medication errors, estimate the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to illustrate the value of incorporating measures of kidney function into the medi- cal decision process. This data set is also mapped through the EHDEN program. Hence, it is also a data partner to the EHDEN Foundation.`},{logo:"/swedishOmopUsers/Goteborgs_universitet_seal.png",name:"University of Gothenburg, Institute of Medicine",link:"https://www.gu.se/forskning/scifi-pearl",info:"Swedish Covid-19 Investigation for Future Insights – a Population Epidemiology Approach using Register Linkage",extra_info:`Fredrik Nyberg was one of the first leaders promoting the use of OMOP in Sweden, during his time as AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca, through the work of Fredrik, was one of the sponsors of the successful European EHDEN Program that standardized and harmonized over 200 data sets across Europe with the help of OMOP and OHDSI tools. 

Fredrik has continued his work with OMOP in different contexts. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, he and his team designed and initiated a nationwide linked multi-register, regularly updated, observational study for timely response to urgent scientific questions (the SCIFI-PEARL Project). This OMOP implementation is the largest and most active in Sweden, and they are a data partner to the EHDEN Foundation. 

Their data set was in April 2025 also approved to become a data partner to EMA’s DARWIN-EU function, which is now enabling them to participate in five new studies together with EMA and many other data partners in the EU. Läkemedelsverket is collaborating with Fredrik’s team at the University of Gothenburg on these studies as the national node for DARWIN-EU in Sweden. They also have an ongoing collaboration on more studies on COVID vaccination of pregnant women and safety for mother and child.

UMC was just like AstraZeneca also part of the consortium running the EHDEN program, and they have at multiple occasions leveraged OMOP-harmonized health data from federated data networks in their studies. They have a new study ongoing at the moment (2025), and this time they are also including Swedish health data.
